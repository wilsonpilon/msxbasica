; chasing the MSX2/2+ boot freeze (docs/SPEC.md module 32d/32g): the extended BIOS's clock-init
; routine polls port $B5 in a loop with NO timeout, waiting for a BCD digit pair in a plausible
; range - fossauro had no handler for $B4/$B5 at all, so reads fell through to the default $FF,
; which never satisfied the check, hanging forever. MSX1 never hits this code path (no extended
; BIOS), which is why the freeze only showed up once MSX2/2+ BIOS loading was implemented.

; fossauro.log is the ONE definitive log for this emulator - every subsystem (General/
; Memory/VDP/PSG/CPU) writes here through LogMsg(), gated only by Verbose. Each category
; also has its own on/off switch (LogCategories bitmask below) so a future settings
; screen/CLI flag can show just "VDP only" or "Memory only" without touching the file
; format or the rotation logic - it's all still the same fossauro.log/.1/.2/... stream,
; just tagged per line ("[VDP] ...", "[MEM] ...", etc.) and filterable at the source.
Global LogFileHandle.i = 0        ; Kept open across calls, never Close'd per line (that

; Log rotation (Linux logrotate style): once fossauro.log reaches #LogMaxBytes, it's
; renamed fossauro.log.1 (bumping any existing .1..#LogMaxBackups-1 up by one, oldest
; dropped) and a fresh empty fossauro.log is started. Checked cheaply via Lof() after
