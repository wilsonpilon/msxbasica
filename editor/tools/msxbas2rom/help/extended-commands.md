# Extended Commands

MSXBAS2ROM extends MSX BASIC with **new commands**.

---

## Why Use Extended Commands?
- Performance optimizations;
- Features unavailable in classic BASIC;
- Better integration with modern tools.

---

## Examples

### General Extended Commands

```basic
10 CMD TURBO 1
20 IF TURBO() THEN PRINT "TURBO MODE IS ON" : END
30 PRINT "CANNOT START TURBO MODE (IS IT A TURBO R OR PANASONIC MACHINE?)"
```

### Memory Extended Commands

```basic
10 SCREEN 1
20 BA% = BASE(5)                           ' screen 1 name table vram address
30 M$ = "HELLO WORLD"
40 S% = LEN(S$)
50 MA% = VARPTR(M$) + 1                    ' message address in RAM 
60 CMD RAMTORAM MA%, HEAP(), S%            ' copy message to next free memory in RAM
70 CMD RAMTOVRAM HEAP(), BA%, S%           ' copy message to screen
80 END
```

### Screen Extended Commands

```basic
FILE "SCREEN.SC2"   ' resource 0
FILE "SCREEN.SC5"   ' resource 1
10 SCREEN 2
20 SCREEN OFF
30 SCREEN LOAD 0
40 SCREEN ON
50 A$ = INPUT$(1)
60 SCREEN 5
70 SCREEN OFF
80 SCREEN LOAD 1
90 SCREEN ON
100 A$ = INPUT$(1)    
```

### Screen Tiled Mode and Fonts Extended Commands

```basic
10 SCREEN 2
20 SET FONT 1
30 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
40 A$ = INPUT$(1)
50 END
```

### Sprite Extended Commands

10 SCREEN 2
20 SPRITE LOAD 0
30 PUT SPRITE 0,(100,100),15,0
40 IF INKEY = 0 THEN 40
50 END
```

### Data Commands

#### Reading plain text files

```basic
FILE "TEXT.TXT"
10 CMD RESTORE 0
20 READ L$ : PRINT L$
30 READ L$ : PRINT L$
40 RESTORE 0   ' reposition to first line of file
50 READ L$ : PRINT L$
```

#### Reading CSV files

```basic
FILE "DATA.CSV"
10 CMD RESTORE 0
20 READ S$
30 IF S$="*" THEN END
40 PRINT S$
50 GOTO 20
```

#### Reading binary files as integers

```basic
FILE "data1.bin"
FILE "data2.bin"
FILE "data3.bin"
10 CMD RESTORE 0  ' 1st file resource
15 IRESTORE 0     ' reposition to file start (byte %0)
20 IREAD A%, B% 
30 PRINT A%, B%
40 CMD RESTORE 1  ' 2nd file resource
45 IRESTORE 2     ' reposition to byte #2 
50 IREAD A%, B% 
60 PRINT A%, B%

```text
  Load a TinySprite (msx.jannone.org) compatible resource (.SPR)

    SPRITE LOAD <resource>

    - Export your sprites as a Backup and save it as .SPR text file;
    - Use with sprite parameter size 2 or 3 on SCREEN statement;
    - You can use, alternatively: BLOAD "file.spr",S

  Set/Get sprite color 

    SET SPRITE COLOR <n>, <8 integers color buffer array>
    GET SPRITE COLOR <n>, <8 integers color buffer array>

### Data Commands

```text
  Set READ statement to get lines from a text resource file (*.TXT or*.CSV) informed on FILE directive

    CMD RESTORE <resource number>

    - Use normal RESTORE <line number> and READ statements to read any specific line from the resource text;
    --- Line number zero is the first line on the resource text;
    --- Each line on TXT files will be treated like an unique string;
    --- Each line on CSV files will be treated like a DATA content;
    - Use IRESTORE <byte number> and IREAD to read binary resources.

```

### Additional Extended Commands

  Write a compressed resource (pletter) to VRAM sprite attribute table

    CMD WRTSPRATR <rsn>
```

## Notes

```text
     - LOCATE/PRINT works in graphical mode (screen 2+) without use of
       OPEN 'GRP:'. When in screen 2 tiled mode, it works similar as text
       mode coords (faster output);
     - CMD WRTSCR/CMD WRTCHR activate the tiled mode in screen 2, forcing text
       mode coords;
     - PUT TILE <char>, (x,y) - for tiled mode used with screens 0-2;
     - RANDOMIZE statement (without parameters) works like a RND(-TIME)
       function;
     - COPY works only with graphical parameters (no files support) just
       like: COPY (x0,y0)-(x1,y1) TO (x2,y2);
       COPY ... TO <ram address> / COPY <ram address> TO ... is accepted
       instead of COPY <array>... (try HEAP() as <ram address>);
       When in screen 2 tiled mode, it works with text mode coords;
     - BLOAD works only to load standard screen files (.SCn) and TinySprite
       compatible files (.SPR). You need to inform a file name as literal (no
       via variables) because it will be loaded into ROM (it will activate
       MegaROM mode). Ex: BLOAD "file.sc5", S;
     - IDATA (integer data) and IREAD (integer read) works similar as DATA/READ
       but use less ROM memory and its faster. Use IRESTORE <position> to
       change the pointer position on binary files resources;
     - DATA statements allocate space in resources page and will be compiled to
       a 48kb ROM;
     - PRINT USING support only numerical formatting symbols (#+-.*$,^0) and
       works the same way as USING$() function. For exponential display,
       include more # in the format string until the correct value is
       displayed. Use 0 char symbol to fill the value with left zeros;
     - F1..F10 function keys return ASCII codes 246 to 255 respectively;
     - Resources total size are limited to 16kb (for FILE directive), and
       when compiled generates 48kb ROMs thats can run as cartridge or in RAM
       with SofaRUN or ODO loaders (ExecROM do not support this ROM size);
